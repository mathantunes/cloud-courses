# AWS EC2 Summary by Ryan Kroonenburg

## EC2 101 Elastic Compute Cloud

Web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

Amazon EC2 **reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances** to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

*Provision Virtual Machines in MINUTES*

### Pricing Models

#### On Demand

Allows to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.

Useful for:
* Users that want low cost and flexibility without any up-front payment or long-term commitment
* Applications with short term, spiky or unpredictable workloads
* Applications being developed or tested for the first time

#### Reserved

Provides capacity reservation, and offer a **SIGNIFICANT** discount on the hourly charge for an instance.

Contract Terms are 1 Year or 3 Year Terms.

Useful for:
* Application with steady state or predictable usage
* Applications that require reserved capacity
* Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further

##### Pricing

* Standard -> 75% off on demand instances
* Convertible Reserved Instances -> 54% off on demand capability
* Schedules Reserved Instances -> Available to launch within the time windows

#### Spot

Enables to bid whatever price wanted for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times

Useful for:
* Apps that have flexible start and end times
* Apps that are only feasible at very low compute prices
* Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity

#### Dedicated Hosts

Physical EC2 server dedicated for own use.

Can help reduce costs by allowing to use with existing server-bound software licenses.

Useful for:
* Regulatory requirements (dedicated host)
* Licensing (i.e. oracle licensing)
* Can be purchased on-demand (hourly)

### Instance Types

Many types of instances specific to some use cases

<img src='./assets/ec2types.png'>


* F -> FPGA
* I -> IOPS
* G -> Graphics
* H -> High Disk Throughput
* T -> Cheap General Purpose
* D -> Density
* R -> RAM
* M -> Main choice for General Purpose apps
* C -> Compute
* P -> Graphics (pics)
* X -> Extreme Memory
* Z -> Extreme Memory and CPU
* A -> Arm-based Workloads
* U -> Bare Metal

### Test Outputs

*EC2 is virtual machines in the cloud*

*Reduces the time required to boot and obtain new instances to minutes*

*Quickly scale capacity up and down*

*Remember Pricing Types*

*If a SPOT instance is terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage, but if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran*

## EC2 Demo

Access EC2
* Launch Instance
* Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
* Choose an Instance Type (t2.micro free-eligible)
* Configure Instance Details
  * Number of instances (1)
  * Purchasing option (on-demand)
  * Network (Default VPC) 
  * Subnet (Default)
  * Auto-assign Public IP (Default)
  * Shutdown behavior (Stop)
  * Enable termination protection (Yes)
  * Monitoring (CloudWatch)
* Add Storage
  * Volume Type (SSD, HDD or Magnetic) 
* Add Tags
* Configure Security Group (Virtual Firewall -> Allows particular Ports)
  * SSH on 22
  * HTTP on 80
* Review Instance Launch
* Key pair generation (FIRST TIME)

SSH In with key pair

yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
nano index.html
```html
<div>Hello</div>
```
service httpd start
chkconfig on

`ec2-3-85-47-76.compute-1.amazonaws.com on browser`

*It is now possible to encrypt root volume*

### Exam TIps

* *Termination Protection is default OFF*
* *On EBS-backed instance, the DEFAULT ACTION IS FOR THE ROOT EBS volume to be DELETED*
* *EBS Root Volumes can now be encrypted*
* *Other volumes are not default deleted* 

## Spot Instances & Spot Fleets

Takes advantage of unused EC2 capacity.

Spot Instances are available up to a **90% discount** compared to On-Demand prices.

Decide a **SPOT PRICE**. The instance will be provisioned so long the Spot Price is **BELOW** the configured maxium

*Spot Blocks* stop Spot Instance termination even if the price is above configured

### Use Cases

* Stateless
* Fault-tolerant
* Flexible
* Big Data workloads
* CI/CD
* WebServers
* HPC
* **NO CRITICAL APPLICATIONS THAT NEED TO BE HIGHLY AVAILABLE**

### Spot Fleets

Collection of Spot Instances and *Optionally* On-Demand Instances

#### Use Cases

If there is available capacity for the Price, it starts Spot Instances
If not, on-demand instances are launched

* Limits to price desire or capacity desire

**Strategies:**
* CapacityOptimized -> Spot Instances come from the pool with optimal capacity for the number of instances launching
* LowestPrice -> Spot Instances come from the pool with the lowest price
* Diversified -> Distributed from all pools
* InstancePoolsToUseCount -> Spot instances are distributed across the number of Spot Instance pools specified

## EC2 Hibernate

The OS is told to perform Hibernation (*Saves the contents from the instance RAM to EBS root volume*)

*Restarts are much faster since RAM state is also stored*

*Keeps the same instance ID*

*Root device volume **MUST** be encrypted*

*Instances **CAN'T** be hibernated for more thant **60 days***

*Service available for On-Demand and Reserver instances **ONLY***

## Boot Strap Scripts

Bash scripting after O.S. initialization

```sh
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y # Install Apache WebServer
service httpd start # Start WebServer
chkconfig httpd on 
cd /var/www/html
echo "<h1>hello</h1>" > index.html # Create index.html
aws s3 mb s3://matheus-jesus-bootstrap-bucket # Create Bucket
aws s3 cp index.html s3://matheus-jesus-bootstrap-bucket # Backup index.html to bucket
```

## Instance Metadata

`curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data -> responds the bootstrap script`

`curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data -> returns all variables that can be fetched`

`curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4 -> returns local ipv4`

`curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4 -> returns public ipv4`

*Metadata is used to get information about the instance*

*Userdata is the bootstrap script*

## Placement Groups

**Not all instance types can be put in placement groups**

*It is possible to move an instance to a group after its creation but it MUST be stopped (can only be done through CLI or SDK*

### Clustered

Grouping of instances withing a single AZ.

Recommended for applications that need **low network latency** and **high network throughput**

### Spread

Each instance placed on distinct underlying hardware (RACKs)

Recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other

*Think of individual instances -> Instances are deployed in separate hardware*

### Partitioned

EC2 divides each group into logical segments called partitions.

EC2 ensures that each partition within a placement group has its own set of racks.

Each rack has its own network and power source.

No TWO partitions within a placement group share the same racks.

Recommended for DB Clusters, HDFS, Cassandra

*Think partition are instance groups, each partition is deployed in separate racks*

# AWS Databases 101 Summary by Ryan Kroonenburg

## Relational Database Services

*Online Transaction Processing*

Made of
* Database
* Tables
  * Columns
  *  Rows

* SQL Server
* Oracle
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Aurora
* MariaDB

### Features

* *Multi AZ - For Disaster Recovery*
  * EC2 Instance connects to a *DNS Endpoint*. AWS updates the DNS if replica is not functional
* *Read Replicas - For Performance*
  * Balance instances to read from different replicas 

## Non Relational Databases

JSON documents

*DynamoDB*

## Data Warehousing

* Cognos
* Jaspersoft
* SQL Server Reporting Services
* Oracle Hyperion

*AWS Redshift* - For Online Analytics Processing

## Caching

AWS ElastiCache - Web service for in-memory cache.

Engines:
* Memcached
* Redis

*Option when database is overloaded*

# RDS

Create Database
* Pick Engine (MySQL)
* DB Instance (myfirstwtf)
* DB User Pass (adminmatheus lala123kkk##)
* DB instance size (db.t2.micro)
* Database Name (myfirst)
* VPC (vpc-rds-1)

* *RDS Runs on Virtual Machines*
* *O.S. pathcing is AWS responsibility*
* *RDS is NOT SERVERLESS (BUT AURORA ENGINE)*

## Back Ups

**Automated Backups**
* Recover database to any point in time between one and 35 days
* Takes full daily snapshots
* Enabled by default
* Backups are stored in S3

**DB Snapshots**
* Manually triggered
* Stored even after deleting the RDS Database

**Restore**
* Restored is a new instance with a new DNS Endpoint

## Encryption

Supported by:
* MySQL
* Oracle
* SQL Server
* PostgreSQL
* MariaDB
* Aurora

Uses KMS.

Once RDS instance is encrypted, the data stored at rest in the storage is encrypted. 

**Backups, replicas and snapshots are encrypted**

## Multi AZ

Supported by:
* SQL Server
* Oracle
* MySQL Server
* PostgreSQL
* MariaDB

Replicates synchronously amongst the Availability Zones.

If an AZ instance is down, AWS updates DNS URL to another AZ

*AWS Manages synchronization*

**Disaster Recovery Only**

## Read Replicas

Replicates **Asynchronously** to *Read Replicas*

EC2 instances must be configured to read from Read Replicas and write to the *primary*

**For read-heavy database workloads**

* *Must have automatic backups ON*
* *Up to 5 read replicas of a db. Read replicas of read replicas are allowed but replication latency can impact*
* *Each replica will have its own DNS endpoint*
* *Can have MULTI AZ*
* *Can be PROMOTED to a database*
* *Read replica in a different **region***

# DynamoDB

NoSQL database

* Single-digit millisecond latency at any scale
* Key-value and Document data models
* Stored on **SSD Storage**
* Spread across 3 greographically distinct data centers
* Read Consistency (**default** is **eventually**, but can be configured to **Strong**)

*Eventual Consistent Reads -> Consistency across all copies of data is usually reached within a second. Repeating a read after a short time should return the updated data. (BEST READ PERFORMANCE)*

*Strongly consistent read returns a result that reflects all writes that received a successful response prior the read*

## Advanced Features

### DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

Fully managed highly available in-memory cache

* 10x performance improvement
* Request time from ms to us
* No need to manage caching logic
* Compatible with DynamoDB API Calls
* Fail resistant. Multiple AZ

`Client -> DynamoDB`

`Client -> DAX -> DynamoDB`

### Transactions

* Multiple all-or-nothing operations
    * Financial Transactions
* Two underlying reads or writes - prepare/commit
* Up to 25 items or 4MB

### On-Demand Capacity

* Pay-per-request pricing
* Balance cost and performance
    * Accomodates RCU and WCU
* No minimum capacity
* No charge for read/write - ONLY STORAGE AND BACKUPS
* *Use it when traffic is not yet known*

### Backup and Restore

* Full backups at any time
* No impact on performance or availability
* Consistent within seconds and **RETAINED UNTIL DELETED**
* Operates within the same region as the source table

### Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)

* Protects against accidental writes or deletes
* Restore to any point in the last 35 days
* Incremental Backups
* **NOT ENABLED BY DEFAULT**
* Latest restorable (5 minutes ago)

### Streams

* Time-ordered sequence of item-level changes in a table
* A shard contains many stream records
* Stored for **24 hours**
* Inserts, Updates and Deletes (all modifications)
* Combine with lambda functions

### Global Tables

Managed multi-master, multi-region replication

* Globally distributed applications
* Based on Streams
* Multi-region redundancy for DR or HA
* No application rewrites
* Replication latency under **one second**

### Database Migration Service (DMS)

`Source DB (Engine) -> DMS -> Target DB (Engine)`

**i.e.**

`MySQL -> DMS -> DynamoDB`

### Security

* Rest encryption with KMS
* Site-to-site VPN
* Direct Connect (DX)
* IAM Policies and Roles
* Fine-grained access
* CloudWatch and CloudTrail
* VPC Endpoints (Private IP addresses between EC2 and DDB)

# Redshift

* OLAP (Online Analytics Processing) transaction
  * `i.e.` Sum of Radios Sold in EMEA

* Data Warehousing use different architectures for best performance

* Single Node Configuration
  * 160GB
* Multi-Node
  * Leader Node (manages client connections and receives queries)
  * Compute Node (store data and perform queries and computations) *Up to 128 Compute Nodes* 

*Takes advantage of advanced compression. -> Column based compression technique*

## Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)
  
* Automatically distributes data and query load across all nodes
* Facilitates Scaling

## Backups

# Caching Strategies

Balancing act between up-to-date, accurate information and latency.

Use Cases

`USR -> CLOUDFRONT -> APIGateway -> Lambda/EC2 -> ElastiCache`

`USR -> CLOUDFRONT -> APIGateway -> Lambda/EC2 -> DynamoDB`

**Try to cache in the nearest to user service**

## CloudFront

Caches media files, videos, pics at **EDGE LOCATIONS**

`USR -> CLOUDFRONT -> ORIGIN (S3,EC2,R53..)`

## API Gateway

## ElastiCache

Memcached and REDIS

## DynamoDB Accelerator

# EMR Overview

Elastic Map Reduce

Industry-leading cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data using o.o tools such as Apache Spark, Hive, HBase,...

**Solution for big data hosted in AWS**

## Cluster

A cluster is a collection of EC2 instances.

Each instance in the cluster is called a node. Each node has a role within the cluster

Node Types:
* Master - Manages the cluster (status of tasks, health)
* Core - Runs tasks and stores data in the Hadoop Distributed File System (at least 1)
* Task - Run tasks but does **NOT** store data (*Optional*)

## Logging

Configure Master Node to periodically archive log files in S3.

* 5 minute intervals
* Can only setup when creating cluster
